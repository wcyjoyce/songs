# Songs

This is a simple Spotify clone that I created with React and Redux as part of [Stephen Grider's](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) Modern React with Redux course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). In this app, users can view a list of songs and click on each song to view more of the song's details.
